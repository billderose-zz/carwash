      <h1 align="center">About</h1>
      <p> We are interested in the flow of traffic at a carwash near our house.
          To measure this, we photograph the queue at set intervals
          and associate with each image a label, namely the number of cars in line at the time the photo was taken, and a timestamp.
          We then train a classifier to predict the number of cars in line given the image as input.
          Once we have sufficient confidence in our classifier, we will use it to generate a time series
          to determine if there are any patterns in usage. For instance, do more
          people wash their car on the weekend? With additional inputs, such as weather, we may answer more difficult questions,
          such as: do we see an increase in the number of people getting carwashes following rain? When things are up and running, we will
          hopefully post answers to these questions in addition to statistics about the performance of our model.
      </p>
      <p> The key phrase in the above paragraph is "once we have sufficient
          confidence in our classifier". That is where you come in. We need as
          much training data as possible, but before we try to apply more
          advanced techniques such as autotagging, we have to manually label our
          images. If you'd like to contribute to our little project,
          tag away. Keep in mind that our view
          is obstructed and often when one car is visible at the turn, there are
          probably 2 cars blocked by the fence and possibly 1 in the actual wash
          itself. A good rule of thumb is # of visible cars + 2.
