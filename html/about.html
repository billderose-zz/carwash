We are interested in the flow of traffic at a carwash near our house.
To measure this, we photograph the queue at set intervals and associate with each image 
a label, namely the number of cars in line at the time the photo was taken, and a timestamp. 
We then train a classifier to predict the number of cars in line given the image as input.
Once we have sufficient confidence in our classifier, we will use it to generate a time series 
to determine if there are any patterns in usage. For instance, do more people wash their car on 
the weekend? With additional inputs, such as weather, we may answer more difficult questions, 
such as: do we see an increase in the number of people getting
carwashes following rain? When things are up and running, we will
hopefully post answers to these questions in addition to statistics
about the performance of our model.

The key phrase in the above paragraph is "once we have sufficient
confidence in our classifier". That is where you come in. We need as
much training data as possible, but before we try to apply more
advanced techniques such as autotagging, we have to manually label our
images. If you'd like to contribute to our little project,
<a href="http://www.carwashr.cloudapp.net">tag away</a>. Keep in mind that our view
is obstructed and often when one car is visible at the turn, there are
probably 2 cars blocked by the fence and possibly 1 in the actual wash
itself. A good rule of thumb is # of visible cars + 2.
